## What is Type Racer Typer?
Type racer typer thingy yeah, it is an auto type. Absolutely destroy your friends on [Type Racer](https://play.typeracer.com/)!

## How to Download?
Head over to [Releases] and download TypeRacerTyperInstaller.zip

If you are not on windows, head to [[Download]]() and download everything there

*more information when you run the program and click the ⓘ*

## Features
- Screen capture text so you don't need to inspect page
- Editable textbox
- Types out text in textbox when told to
- 3 second timer to adjust your mouse and where you want the program to type
- Random weird lisence when you install the program

## Read Me if you want
- The .exe file will automatically use the jre as long as they are in the same directory(the .exe file won’t use your pre-installed jre, I will find a solution to that and I will update this folder)
- The .jar file will try to use a preinstalled version of java (jre) if you don’t have it then you need to download the customjre or one from the official website. Then you need to open Terminal/Command Prompt and do “dir of customjre” -jar “dir of the jar” you can try to put that into a runnable file on your os to make it run when you double click the new file you’ve created.
The Windows x64 installer is just an installer and works like every other application.

Also, the tessdata folder has to be in the same directory as the program running.
